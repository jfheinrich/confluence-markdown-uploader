# CODEOWNERS file
# 
# This file defines code ownership for the repository.
# Users or teams listed here will be automatically requested for review
# when a pull request modifies files matching the patterns.
#
# For organization-owned repositories, it's recommended to use team references
# (e.g., @org/team-name) rather than individual users to ensure that code owner
# reviews are properly recognized by branch protection rules.
#
# SETUP REQUIRED: Create a 'maintainers' team at:
# https://github.com/orgs/jfheinrich-eu/teams
# Then add @jfheinrich and other maintainers to the team.
#
# For more information, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Default owner for everything in the repo
# This ensures all PRs get a review request
# For organization-owned repositories, using a team reference ensures
# that code owner reviews are properly recognized by branch protection rules
