## Contributing

This repository uses branch protection for the `main` branch to ensure code quality and security. All contributions must:

- Be submitted via pull requests
- Pass automated CI checks (ShellCheck and POSIX compliance)
- Receive approval from code owners
- Have all conversations resolved

### Code Owners Setup

This repository uses GitHub's CODEOWNERS feature to automatically request reviews from maintainers. For organization-owned repositories, we use a team-based approach to ensure reviews are properly recognized.

If you're setting up this repository or managing code owners, see the [CODEOWNERS Setup Guide](.github/CODEOWNERS_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.
